			<p>Studying in one of the premier institutes of India, IIT Guwahti I found myself at the conjunction of design and technology. I am a pre-final year student and is one year short of becoming a Chemical Engineer by qualification but a designer by choice. Besides making the world beautiful, I am more focused about changing the way a human interacts with the world.<br><br> Uptill now in college, I co-founded a social media based app, been a part of various projects, interned in a few places as an experience designer, headed the design module of a symposium and freelanced as a graphic designer. </p>

			<p>It all started 1 year back with giving wings to my idea of a social media based app to revolutionize the learning structure after which I believe my dedication helped me in learning various aspects of UI/UX. My attitude towards learning new things and creating smooth, intuitive and pleasant user experiences is something I find myself passionate about.<br><br>Things that interest me include Design, Front-End Development, Artificial Intelligence and yeah! Call of Duty and Coffee.&#9749 If we share the same enthusiasm for anything above, hit me up!</p>
